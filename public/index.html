			<h1>Server Rules</h1>
			<p id="rule-agreement">By playing on the CGI server you agree to the rules.</p>

			<!--1.1 Administration Policies-->
			<div class="rule-container">
				<h2>1.1 Administration Policies</h2>
				<p>Do not argue with admins and please obey any given warning. Any
					admin verdict is final and can only be appealed via our Discord
					support-tool. If you decide to argue with an admin in game chat,
					it will result in a kick or ban from our server.</p>
				<p>To contact our admins, please type !admin in chat and type your
					reason after it. Any message that just contains !admin will be
					ignored. Do NOT use the admin ping to spam the admins.</p>
				<p>Impersonating an admin or any CGI member is prohibited and will
					result in a permanent ban from our servers.</p>
			</div>

			<!--1.2 General Etiquette-->
			<div class="rule-container">
				<h2>1.2 General Etiquette</h2>
				<p>We do not tolerate any racist, sexist, extreme-nationalist, or other
					discriminatory or insulting behaviors. This applies to text chat,
					voice chat, squad names and usernames. This kind of behavior will
					lead to a permanent ban.</p>
				<p>We do not tolerate any form of hacking and cheating. This kind of
					behavior will lead to a permanent ban.</p>
				<p>We do not tolerate any kind of intentional team killing, even in
					retaliation. If you have a problem, please call an admin to support
					you. Intentional team kills will lead to a ban from our server.</p>
				<p>Discussion of team-internal intelligence is strictly prohibited.
					Sharing such information (ticket count, location of FOBs, vehicles,
					etc.) will result in administrative measures. AKA Ghosting.</p>
				<p>We do not allow advertisement of any kind in chat, usernames or
					squad names.</p>
			</div>

			<!--1.3 Communication Policy-->
			<div class="rule-container">
				<h2>1.3 Communication Policy</h2>
				<p>Please always be respectful to one another.</p>
				<p>Music/audio spam is unwanted on our server. This is valid
					permanently in the staging phase, the start of the round, the round
					itself as well as during the end screen. If you are asked to stop
					playing music/sounds by any player, that is considered a warning, as
					the music is disrupting the gameplay experience. Admins have the
					final verdict on what is a violation.</p>
				<p>English is the official language of our server; however, every
					player is welcome. We require squad leaders to have a basic level of
					spoken English language so they can communicate with other squad
					leaders. </p>
				<p>Ensure you use English wherever possible.</p>
				<p>Within squads, any language is permitted. This means that
					you are allowed to speak any language that you wish, but please state
					your squad language in your squad name. You are NOT allowed to lock
					your squad due to using another language.</p>
			</div>

			<!--2.1 General Rules-->
			<div class="rule-container">
				<h2>2.1 General Rules</h2>
				<p>Leadership roles MUST have and use a microphone as well as a squad
					leader kit.</p>
				<p>All infantry squads MUST be led by an infantry squad leader. There
					are no exceptions.</p>
				<p>All vehicle squads MUST be led by a lead crewman. There are no
					exceptions.</p>
				<p>Players who create a squad MUST have every intention to lead the
					squad. If you are lacking this intention, do not create a squad. If
					you find yourself with a dropped squad lead role, please ask if
					someone wants to have it. Otherwise, you are asked to disband the
					squad.</p>
				<p>We require teamwork on this server to achieve our server goals. If
					you are playing in an obstructive way, including not communicating
					with the team, you may be removed from the server.</p>
				<p>We ask everybody to actively help in balancing the server,
					especially when asked by an admin. We expect all clans, communities
					and experienced players to support the balancing-progress.</p>
				<p>Every player is obliged to join a squad. Unassigned players are
					considered AFK and can be kicked at any point.</p>
				<p>On our server, you are NOT allowed to lock your squad except for:
					Infantry squads with 6 or more members,
					Logistics and helo squads with 3 or less members,
					Crewman-Vehicle squads with 2 – 4 members,
					Admin squads.
					However, you must unlock your squad when asked by an admin.</p>
				<p>Please be civil when kicking people from your squad. If you are
					kicked from a squad, simply join a different squad. If the reason you
					were kicked conflicts with one of our server rules (racism, sexism,
					discrimination) please report it. However this is not a free license
					to not respect our locked-squads rule, soft-locking your squad will
					result in admin intervention.</p>
			</div>

			<!--2.2 Teamkilling-->
			<div class="rule-container">
				<h2>2.2 Teamkilling</h2>
				<p>Intentional teamkilling is strictly prohibited on our server.
					Revenge team killing is also prohibited. If you find a player
					trolling or teamkilling, contact an admin.</p>
				<p>Teamkills can happen in the heat of the battle. This is why we
					should acknowledge them and apologize for teamkills in all chat. Not
					acknowledging teamkills might result in administrative measures.</p>
				<p>If you are found guilty of intentionally teamkilling and playing it
					off as an accident, you will potentially face a permanent ban.</p>
				<p>The only exceptions to intentional team killing are:
					Helping a stuck player to respawn, suicide bikes.
					Please explain the situation in chat regardless.</p>
			</div>

			<!--2.3 Vehicle Claims-->
			<div class="rule-container">
				<h2>2.3 Vehicle Claims</h2>
				<p>To gain a claim on a vehicle, in your squad name you must include:
					MBT – To claim a main battle tank,
					IFV/APC – To claim any other vehicle requiring a crewman kit to
					operate,
					HELI/HELO – To claim a helicopter,
					LOGI – To claim a logistics truck.</p>
				<p>You only have a claim if you also have enough players in your squad
					to crew your vehicle. You are then allowed to keep this vehicle over
					other squads.</p>
				<p>If there are multiple valid claims on the same vehicle, it will
					always be the first squad in the vehicle.</p>
				<p>Note that every squad is only allowed to claim one vehicle by this
					system. Feel free to use more than one vehicle, if they would
					otherwise be unused in base. If a squad opens a claim on that
					vehicle, please hand it over.</p>
				<p>If you have multiple claims in your squad name, all claims are
					invalid. Calling your squad “ARMOR” is not considered a claim at all.</p>
				<p>Please note, that any other vehicle that does not require a crewman
					kit (e.g. the Tigr-M, M-ATV, TAPV, etc.) cannot be claimed, meaning
					that your squad is still defined as an infantry squad by our rules.
				</p>
				<p>A Command Squad is always defined as an infantry squad by our rules.</p>
			</div>

			<!--2.4 Infantry Squads-->
			<div class="rule-container">
				<h2>2.4 Infantry Squads</h2>
				<p>Infantry squads are defined as the majority of players in the squad
					having infantry squad roles and having no valid vehicle claim.</p>
				<p>A squad leader is only allowed to use another kit due to a valid
					combat situation, such as repairing, building or using AT. However
					this only allowed for a brief moment and the leader has to revert to
					his original kit as soon as possible. If an admin asks you to get a
					leader kit, you must switch to the kit at the earliest available
					opportunity.</p>
				<p>Infantry squads are free to take whatever vehicle assets they want,
					as long as they is not already claimed by another squad. These squads
					can not create a claim on any vehicle.</p>
			</div>

			<!--2.5 Crewman-Vehicle Squads-->
			<div class="rule-container">
				<h2>2.5 Crewman-Vehicle Squads</h2>
				<p>Vehicle squads are defined as the players in the squad are operating
					a claimable vehicle that needs crewman kits.</p>
				<p>The squad leader must then use the lead crewman kit. This squad has
					to have a valid claim on a vehicle, as well as a minimum of 2 and a
					maximum of 4 players in the squad to run the vehicle. If these
					criteria are not fulfilled, your claim is invalid and your squad may
					at any point be disbanded, followed by a kick or even ban from the
					server at repeated violation.</p>
				<p>Any vehicle that needs a crewman kit to be operated needs to be
					operated by at least two players at any time. You are not allowed to
					pick up your member in the field going from base.</p>
				<p>If you find your vehicle one-manned in the field due to the other
					player getting killed or disconnecting, you have to attempt to fall
					back to a safe HAB to pick up another player at the earliest
					available opportunity. You are not allowed to engage enemies whilst
					being solo in a vehicle, except for defence.</p>
			</div>

			<!--2.6 Logistics and Helicopter Squads-->
			<div class="rule-container">
				<h2>2.6 Logistics and Helicopter Squads</h2>
				<p>Logistic squads are defined as squads that are not actively
					participating in combat, but instead focus on carrying building or
					ammunition materials as well as other squads’ infantry to certain
					points of the map to reinforce and resupply them.</p>
				<p>Logistics may defend themselves if being attacked, but should not
					participate in any large engagements with enemy troops.</p>
				<p>The squad name has to make visible that this squad is focusing on
					logistics only. By this, one logi is claimed for your squad.</p>
				<p>Helicopter squads are defined as squads that focus on carrying
					building or ammunition material as well as other squads’ infantry to
					certain points of the map to reinforce and resupply them. In contrast
					to logistic squads, a helicopter squad may engage enemies with their
					vehicle or be used to scout out enemy positions and their movement.</p>
				<p>The squad has to have a valid claim on a helicopter asset. The squad
					leader has to use a specialised role kit (lead pilot kit) at all
					times. They are allowed to use another kit just like crewman-vehiclesquad leaders, but have to change back as
					soon as possible.</p>
				<p>Before taking off in the helicopter, please, make sure that you have
					the sufficient skill to fly it. Our server is not the practice range.
					Flying a helicopter without any prior experience may be considered
					asset-wasting.</p>
				<p>If an admin asks you to get a squad leader kit, you must switch to
					the kit at the earliest available opportunity.</p>
			</div>

			<!--2.7 Wasting Assets-->
			<div class="rule-container">
				<h2>2.7 Wasting Assets</h2>
				<p>Intentionally wasting assets is strictly prohibited and will result
					in administrative measures.</p>
				<p>Nevertheless we do not consider bad decisions that lead to loss of
					assets as asset-wasting in the sense of this rule.
					Some examples of asset-wasting are
					Driving assets into deep water or off the map,
					Intentionally abandoning assets in the field,
					Intentionally crashing your vehicle into enemy lines/assets, with the
					exception of VBIEDs,
					Trying to fly helicopters without training or/and experience</p>
				<p>Losing vehicle after vehicle might be considered asset wasting and
					will result in another player or admin asking you to cease this
					behaviour. If you continue, there will be actions taken against you.</p>
				<p>Intentionally digging down friendly FOBs/HABs and structures or
					destroying friendly vehicles without a valid reason is prohibited,
					except when:
					Destroying unrecoverable abandoned vehicles,
					Removing a structure due to bad placement with the intention to
					rebuild it,
					Removing a friendly FOB to prevent enemies from destroying it.</p>
			</div>

			<!--2.8 Main Base Camping-->
			<div class="rule-container">
				<h2>2.8 Main Base Camping</h2>
				<p>When a main base is considered camped depends on the actual case.
					The admin decision is final. If there are issues, please open a
					complaint on our discord server. Do not discuss the verdict.</p>
				<p>Main base camping is defined as placing assets, infantry or
					explosives, at any distance, with the intent to destroy or harm enemy
					assets that are entering or leaving the enemy main base. If you are
					within a 400m range of the enemy base, you are most likely considered
					main base camping.</p>
				<p>The only exceptions for being within 400m of the enemy base are:
					When the points or objectives are within that boundary or enemies are
					fighting from it,
					When you are maneuvering or flanking, it’s advised to pass through
					this space without engaging enemies entering or leaving main,
					If a FOB is placed inside this radius to their main base, then all
					assets in the area are considered fair game.</p>
				<p>If an admin considers your actions base camping, you will be warned.
					If you decide to ignore this, an administrative action will be taken
					against you.</p>
